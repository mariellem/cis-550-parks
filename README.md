Group Project

<h1> Parks Planner Plus </h1>

Welcome to Parks Planner Plus! Our site visualizes all of the need-to-know information for planning a trip to any of the sixty-three US National Parks. The underlying database combines data from many different sources, which is queried in a highly-optimized manner to provide a seamless experience. Our technology stack includes Python for data cleaning, AWS RDS for hosting the database, mySQL queries, and React and Node.js for the front-end application. Please follow the instructions below to get started, and happy hiking!
